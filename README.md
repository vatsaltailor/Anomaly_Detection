# Anomaly Detection

Do you wish to leverage the power of Machine Learning to detect anomalies super easily? This notebook demonstrates a pure data-driven approach to detect anomalies in your data using Isolation Forest.

No matter the number of features at hand or the data, this pure data-driven approach is bound to work :)

 - Easy EDA
 - Easy Modelling with just one hyperparameter to keep in mind
 - Easy result visualization using PCA
